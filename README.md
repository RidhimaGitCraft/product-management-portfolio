#**About Me**
Hi, my name is Ridhima Singh. I am currently in my 2nd year, 3rd semester, pursuing a Master's in Information Technology and Management from Illinois Tech. With over 6 years of industry experience, including 4 years as a project manager, I've gained significant insights and skills in product management. During my recent summer internship, I worked as a product manager, which allowed me to deepen my understanding of the field. In this portfolio, I showcase various projects and case studies that highlight my journey and expertise in product management.
